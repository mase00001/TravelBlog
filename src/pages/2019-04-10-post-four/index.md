###Queenstown
From there the trip got lots sunnier. We ate a famous Fergburger, for which we had to stand in line for a bit- a bit more than a bit since some people tried to sneakily pop into the line in front of us- which was worth the wait; walked to the peak of a hill from where lots off flying foxes and mountain bikes came down; and went for a drive and had a nice picnic on yet another hill with a beer and an awesome view.

That night we camped, to Daniels liking, at a cricket ground and the next day we went on a hike, exchanging the sunlight for some snow!

###Glacier visits
The next day we had a bit of a drive to visit some glaciers. To be very honest, we both think they’re really only worth a visit if you take the time to do a guided glacier tour with crampons. From below, there’s not much to see. Later on the trip we did meet a couple on their honeymoon, who got married on top of one of the glaciers we visited. Those photo’s, contrary to ours, looked stunning!!

That night we stayed at a campground behind a pub, the ‘historic empire hotel’. We had some nice beers, played some tunes at the jukebox and skyped with my family who was having a family day on the other side of the world in the Netherlands. The sleep was a bit restless though, since the fire alarm went off (for hours!!) and everyone got out of their tents to check what was going on. In other words: cool place to stay, but not the most relaxing stay.

###Punakaiki pancake rocks and blowholes
The following day we drove all the way to the North, following the beautiful Highway 6 coastal drive, stopping by the Punakaiki pancake rocks and blowholes: an iconic walkway showing the force of nature. Be aware, the place where our photo was taken from might not exist anymore after another decade of salt water invasions. That night we relaxed at the beach with a beer, preparing for our final hiking track in New Zealand (at least for this trip!).

###Abel Tasman National park- Abel Tasman coast track
Day 1
The 60km track along the north coast of the South Island starts at Mãrahau, where you follow a boardwalk over the coast and then continue into beech forest area with large Kãnuka trees. We camped on the beach (really on the beach!!) where we unfortunately realised we’d already ran out of gas. Quickly making as much couscous as the recently boiled water could handle and with the knowledge that most of our dinners that week would consist of raw veggies, we prepared for the first night of the hike.

###Rest of the days
Parts of this beautiful coastal track can only be walked when it’s low tide (either over shells or through beautifully warm water where you can go for a swim). You can always choose the alternative and take the so called ‘all tide track’, but if you want to stick to the ocean a little bit of planning is involved. Be prepared for beautiful campsites right on the beach (!), amazing nature, lots of sunshine and maybe even some dolfins or even a seal (!) when you take a watertaxi during the coastal track or on your way back to Mãrahau, since it’s a one-way track.

As you can imagine the first meal after the ‘Abel raw food track’ tasted like the most delicious tapas meal ever!
