Creta embodies all things great about Greece, beautiful beaches with crystal clear water, mountains and gorges providing breathtaking walks, picturesque villages with much history and many archeological sites to explore. There is something for everyone on this island and we were pleasantly surprised at the diversity of things to see and explore. During our 10 days on Creta we predominatley stuck to the West side of the Island as we didnt want to spend too much time on the road. Below are are a list of places we visited and our impressions.



###1. Chania

This is one of the two main cities on the island located on the North side and is where we flew into to begin our adventure. Chania has a relaxed vibe and makes for a good place to base yourself as you explore the island. First thing I would recommend doing is walking along the Old Vanetian Port of Chania. Built initially in the 14th century to protect against pirate raids, it is now the heart of Chania providing many bars, restaurants and shops along with very nice views.

###2. Samarian Gorge

The Samarian Gorge is the most well known gorge to visit on Crete and one of the main tourist attractions on the island with good reason. The spectacular views at the very beginning along with hiking through the gorge itself, where side rock walls can reach as high as 300m, makes for unforgettable experience.

To get there, we started in Chania and drove to the beginning of the trail which is right near the village of Omalos. You can also opt to take the public bus from Chania to Omalos or take a guided tour which will cost a little more but has everything organised for you. Entry fee to the park is 5 euros and you will need another 20 euros to catch the ferry at the end of the trail to Sougia where you can then catch a bus back to the trail carpark or to Chania. The walk is 16km so allow 4-6 hours

###3. Elafonisi Beach

One of the more beautiful beaches you will come across with aqua blue water and nice spots to relax. When you first arrive, the main area of the beach is generally very packed especially on a hot summers day, but walk a bit further over some dunes and you will come across a much quieter area to settle and enjoy the sun.

###4. Sougia to Hora Sfakion Hike

This hike goes along the south side coastline of Creta. We solved the problem of transport by firstly driving to Hora Sfakion where the hike will end and then catching the ferry to Sougia and hiking back from where we came. The hike is 20km in total and took us roughly 8 hours so make sure you get a ferry early in the morning to allow enough time to complete the walk. Many sign posts mark the trail as well so it is hard to get lost.

Loutro is a very picturesque town you will encounter along the way is not accessable by car giving it an air of exclusiveness about it. Nice place to stop for lunch and recharge for the rest of journey ahead. The last section from Loutro to Horo Sfakion is arguable to the best, taking you through an up and down path giving some amazing views of the seaside and landscape. You will pass sweet water beach as well which is a nice beach to stop by and enjoy the water.

###5. Anopoli and Aradena Gorge

After spending 5 nights in Chania, we drove to Anopoli, a small quiet village approximately a 10 minute drive inland from Horo Sfakion. Great place to stay if you want to get away from the busy cities. The locals were also very friendly and gave us some tips on what to do around the area. This lead us to attempting the Aradena Gorge walk, which in the opinion of many is just as good as the Samarian Gorge walk without the mass flood of tourists. The gorge will lead down to the coast and finish at Marmara beach where we chilled for a couple hours before heading back.

At some point you can either choose to take a path which takes you down some ladders or walk over an overpass as shown below.

On the return walk we decided to take the ladder path back instead of the overpass mentioned earlier. Was an entertaining way to come back.

###6. Agios Nikolas

From Anopoli we decided to head more east and make our way to Agios Nikoaos, another very pretty coastal town of Greece. In the center there is a small port lined with restaurants and bars and a large hill which overlooks the whole village. We had dinner at a restaurant called Gioma Meze atop of the hill which made for a nice night out. If you're into ancient ruins then it might be worth taking a trip up to Spinalonga Fortress located only 30 minute drive away. We also did scuba diving through a local scuba outlet who were very friendly and took us out by boat to a good spot filled with many fish.

###7. Syvritos

Our last destination before returning home was a small village called Syvritos which is located in the center of Crete in a beautiful valley. Surrounded my mountains including the largest one called Mount Ida, this really is a beautiful place to stay during the summer months. If you're after a quiet a relaxing place with incredible landscape then this area is a must. On top of that, there are many hikes to be done, including hiking to the top of Mount Ida which is easily accessible from Syvritos.
Unfortunately we were only staying a night and so ran out of time to complete this but it would be worth doing on a clear day.
