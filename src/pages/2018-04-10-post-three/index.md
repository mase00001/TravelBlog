After having met in San Fransisco (USA), having lived in Melbourne (Australia) both at the same time as friends and meeting up again in Innsbruck (Austria) as ‘friends’, we decided to give our relationship a real shot by taking an adventurous trip to New Zealand. To the South Island of New Zealand, to be more specific.

###Christchurch, a city marked by earthquakes

We arrived in Christchurch on a very rainy and cloudy day and instantly understood why there were so many brightly green coloured hills. We came to the island mainly for its beautiful walks and campsites situated in amazing national parks. The first night in Christchurch we spent in an AirBnB however, in the house of two very dedicated and lovely AirBnB hostesses (please send us a message if you’d like recommendations). We rented a car and were surprised by the amount of construction work that was going on in the city. Not surprising though, since one day before our airplane landed in Christchurch, one of many earthquakes had happened. The one preceding our arrival was a minor one, but we heard from locals that many bigger ones had happened in the past. Because of the earthquake preceding our arrival a road in the North was blocked and we had to adjust our roadtrip. Since we’d decided to ‘go with the flow’ we didn’t really have anything to readjust. We headed for Mt Cook and had a stunning 4 hour drive.

###Aoraki/Mt Cook National Park

This first destination was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. Mt Cook is a 3.724m high mountain that can be viewed from a hiking track leading up to the mountain, starting from the similarly named village. The village itself, or more specifically the ‘White horse hill campsite’ that’s situated at the start of the ‘Hooker valley’ hiking trail, is one of the most special places we’ve visited. While in front of your tent, you’re completely surrounded by mountains from the Southern Alps. The 3 hour trail to Mt Cook is easy but stunning, starting with the ‘Lower hooker suspension bridge’ giving you beautiful alpine scenery and a nice view of the Hooker river that follows a great part of the track. After some more stunning views you’ll end, in our case pretty soaked from rain but very happy, at the ice-cold Mt Cook lake that houses big chunks of icy snow..

<br />

The next day we walked up to a beautiful viewpoint to see one of the several glacier lakes and one day after that one we walked up to another cold but nice viewpoint.

That evening, from our campsite, we watched a stunning sunset being reflected on the white snowy tops of the mountains.

###Fiordlands national park
The following day we started our multiple day visit to the Fiordland national park, starting with a visit to ‘Mirror lakes’ which, in our opinion, isn’t really worth a visit, and then headed further into the Fiordland national park. Along the Milford road, we stayed in one of the DOC camping areas; camping grounds with drop toilets that are minded by the national park staff and are based on an honesty policy where you drop your money in a small squared box and hang the additional tag at your tent.

<br />


###Fiordlands - Routeburn track
On the next day we walked the famous Routeburn track, starting in a densely packed bushy area hiking up towards a beautiful waterfall and several amazing lookouts. Since we logistically only had one day to hike the entire track, it wasn’t possible to finish the whole trail and then find transportation back to the start of it. Instead we decided to ‘make haste’ and walk the 2-4 day hiking track in one day, hiking up to the highest top halfway the track and then coming back in the same direction. The hike was amazing and had a variety of different sights and views.

###Fiordlands - Milford Sound track
If there’s one thing we would have known if we’d done a tiny bit more research into our trip before we arrived, it would have been how important it is to pre-book your Milford Sound hike before attending. Since luck was on our side, some people had cancelled their trip, leaving two spots for us starting a day after we inquired information at the information centre. That very next day we took the boat from Te Anau Downs (1 hour trip, 3 scheduled daily boat services (10.30 am, 1pm and 2pm)) to the start of the track at Glade Warf at the head of Lake Te Anau.

The Milford sound track, a guided or self-guided track of 53.5km taking 4 days, is probably the most amazing hike we’ve ever done. The self-guided track leads you to 3 different bungalow grounds where you will be welcomed by very friendly national park staff and can claim a bunkbed upon arrival. On this track we met some cool likeminded people, but we also loved the fact that you could go your own way and be a bit secluded from the rest of the people in this beautiful nature area. The same track is also done by guided tour groups, guiding tourists with small daypacks that are regularly provided by hot cups of tea.  A good option for people who do like luxuriousness and still want to experience this beautiful track.

###Day 1

The first day is a short, 5km bushy trail that leads up to a nice lake just before you arrive at the first hut called Clinton Hut. This day we spent socializing and in the evening we walked with the guide that was minding the park to find some spectacular glow-worms. Tip for the night: bring some earplugs since there will always be some snorers in the group and in this hut you sleep  in the same room  as half of the group does.

###Day 2

On day 2 we walked through a valley and were very lucky with the rainy weather of the past weeks, giving us lots of waterfalls falling down from either side of the valley. We also had to walk over some rocky parts created by previous avalanches, of which some parts were more easily accessible than others (be prepared for wet feet!). 

<div class="wrap"><div class="small"><img src="/images/35.jpg" /></div><div class="small"><img src="/images/36.jpg" /></div></div>
<br />

Once you get closer to the hut, the first little climb of the track starts. With feet that were completely drenched because of all the little river crossings on todays 16.5 km hike, we arrived at Mintaro hut where we spent our second night. Here everyone, including ourselves, hang their shoes/jackets/socks to dry.

###Day 3

This is probably the most spectacular day of the hike; the route over the Mackinnon Pass. On this day you make a steep but easy climb up to the highest and only big peak of the track…

<div class="wrap"><div class="small"><img src="/images/39.jpg" /></div><div class="small"><img src="/images/40.jpg" /></div></div>
<br />

… until you reach the amazing summit, where we were surprisingly enough joined by a Kea bird, one of the national birds, which had seemed to come up the mountain with much more ease.

<br />


Just below that very summit was a bunker with a drop toilet, very well known for its most amazing view. Take a seat, leave the door open and enjoy the view. On the other side of the hill everything is just as green, waterfall-full and beautiful. We hiked to the highest waterfall of New Zealand, the Sutherland Falls. With a height of 580m the water clatters down from a lake at the top of the mountain range, landing at our feet. We were persuaded by the temptation of coolness the falls produced, took part of our clothes off and went for a swim… leaving us with a towel tail.

The last leg of the trip was a bit rainy, but we made it to sandfly point, the end of the 33.5 mile track.
