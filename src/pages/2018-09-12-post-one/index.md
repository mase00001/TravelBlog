While on a tour with the Aussie family through the Netherlands, we decided to make a little trip to Bruges (Brugge) in Belgium. Maybe simply to show how easy it is in Europe to get from one country to the next. Bruges is definitely worth a visit for everyone though, whether you’re from Australia or somewhere within Europe. It’s a cute little city well known for its tourists... Just kidding, but you do have to be prepared to push your way through some tourists, especially in summertime. Mainly during daytime the city can be busy, since most visitors seem to be day trippers, leaving the city centre nice and quiet at night time. The city really does have something for everyone though:

###The cultural tourist
The best way to start a cultural trip through Bruges, is to go to one of the several little kiosks by the waterfront that sell tickets to go on a boat trip that takes about 30 minutes. This is how we started our cultural adventure and it gives you a nice idea about how the historical centre is built. In addition, the canal views were stunning. We were lucky to have some nice and sunny weather on the boat and started our trip with our first group photo in Bruges.

Whilst cruising through the canals we got some nice views of the old 112 meter high Catholic ‘Church of our lady’ and the Saint John’s Hospital, an 800 year old building where monks and nuns used to take care of pilgrims, locals and travellers like us. I marked all the interesting buildings that seemed worth a visit on google maps and made sure to mark a brewery with a nice terrace at the canal as well (Brewery Bourgogne des Flandres). After finishing the trip, we bought one of the famous Belgium waffles that are everywhere to be found (our choice of venue wasn’t a particularly good one so I won’t make any recommendations here, just use your nose and pick a good smelling one). With the waffle on the go we started our wonder through the streets. We made a stop by the very impressive town hall, which is situated next to the similarly stunning looking Basilica all situated on the square called ‘The Burg’.

From there we continued our way to another famous square called ‘Market square’ that houses the impressive 83-meter high Bell tower called ‘Belfry tower’ first built in 1248. After waiting in line for about five minutes we, or should I say Sanne, got impatient so we decided to skip our trip to the top and have a look at the other impressive buildings. Making our way through the city we visited the previously highlighted places to visit and continued our way to the only place in Bruges that is completely quiet.

###The silence loving tourist
If you’re not too keen on noise, please visit the Beguinage (Negijnhof), as we did. We were quite surprised by the sudden transition of busy Bruges to this quit square with a green convent garden in the middle and white painted houses surrounding it. Upon seeing the church that is situated in between the houses and one nun quietly talking to someone in front of one of the white buildings, we realised all the houses were inhabited by nuns of the Order of Saint Benedict. Later I read that some of the buildings are also inhabited by a couple of ladies who decided to stay unmarried. We made a quick visit to the church, absorbed the peacefulness that this part of the cities emits and continued our way to the park.

###The nature loving tourist
The city of Bruges holds a reasonably sized park called ‘Minnewaterpark’ where we concluded the day. Whilst some of us had a visit in the little castle that nowadays houses a café by the lake, I read some information about the park on one of the information boards. I discovered that the famous ‘Minnewater’ lake has been called after ‘Minnen’; water ghosts that house underneath bridges. A later search on Google revealed a complete different story about it being named after a girl who was denied to marry her great love. However the exact story may be, the park was a nice and relaxing retreat to conclude our busy day.

###The fun seeking tourist
On our way back home we came across something quite peculiar. In the ‘Magdalenachurch’ we saw a big pond with a fountain in the middle and a sculpture of a lady behind it. That by itself was already very new to us, but the thing behind it was even more spectacular.

Not quite knowing whether allowed to laugh or not, we each went on to the gigantic swing and experienced the beauties of the church through a completely different view. Whilst ‘swinging my way’ through the church, looking at my family members, I realised this exhibition brought people together on the fake patch of grass in the middle of the church. And shouldn’t that be one of the churches goals, bringing people together, religious or not?

###The beer loving tourist
If you’re a beer lover like we are, you’ll love Bruges (and frankly all Belgium’s cities). We started one of our nights with a pubcrawl, taking the parents (in law) to the underground pub called ‘’t Poatersgat’

We wanted to end our pubcrawl at a delicious and highly recommended Jazzy dinner place called ‘Bistro ‘t Zwart Huis’ (the black house). We forgot to make a reservation, so went to a different café at the Eggmarket for some more crafted beers s(please try their homebrand ‘Brugse Zot’ and the every delicious ‘Tripple Karmeliet’). Upon our return at the Bistro the had a spot for us and we enjoyed a delicious meal that made everyone, even though quite jolly and a tiny bit tipsy before, quiet and satisfied.
